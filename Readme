NotHards client to search multi and single agent levels!

Compilation is done by running 'make' in this directory. The binary, called searcher, is created in the folder bin.
Compilation tested on Arch linux and ubuntu.

The client takes one input; the amount of memory in MB. We recommend running at 1500. Running it on the competition server would then be e.g:
java -jar cserver.jar -d competition_levels/ -c "bin/searcher 1500"

There is also a binary supplied already, which is created using Arch Linux, and meant for this platform. We recommend recompiling (make clean -> make) for the platform of desire.

The script benchmarking.py is only for optional, handy use. It takes a log-folder from e.g. the cserver, e.g. output.out, and prints the solved levels with time and action, as well as the unsolved levels.


The levels supplied in the levels-folder are levels from the report.
